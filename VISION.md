# MCSS Vision

MCSS (Mail Configuration Scoring System) is a framework for evaluating the operational maturity of mail infrastructure configurations.

MCSS is designed to help transform technical configuration verification into a decision-support methodology for infrastructure quality improvement.

The framework aims to help technical teams and infrastructure operators better understand configuration quality, operational risk patterns, and long-term system reliability trends.

MCSS is not designed as a commercial or competitive marketing tool.

It is designed as a technical quality measurement methodology that can support operational improvement and technical decision making.

## Purpose

Modern mail infrastructures must balance:
- Deliverability reliability  
- Security configuration quality  
- Operational consistency  
- Technical maintainability  

MCSS was created to provide a structured way to evaluate these properties using repeatable scoring models.

---

## Philosophy

MCSS is based on three core principles.

### Measurable Quality
Configuration quality should be measurable using clear operational criteria.

---

### Operational Improvement
The goal of assessment is not only evaluation, but guidance for improvement.

MCSS is designed to help technical teams identify priority areas for intervention.

---

### Practical Independence
MCSS is designed to be applicable across different mail server technologies and deployment models.

---

## Scope

MCSS focuses on mail infrastructure configuration maturity, including but not limited to:

- Mail authentication configuration quality  
- Infrastructure reliability indicators  
- Operational configuration consistency  

MCSS is not a compliance certification system.

It is a decision support framework for technical quality improvement.

## Community

MCSS welcomes collaboration from mail infrastructure operators, MSPs, and technical teams working with email systems in production environments.
