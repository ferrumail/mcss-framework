# Why MCSS Exists

Most infrastructure quality is currently evaluated using fragmented methods.

Organizations usually check:
- Security
- Compliance
- Performance

But rarely evaluate configuration maturity as a whole system property.

MCSS was created to address this gap.

The philosophy behind MCSS is:

1. Quality must be measurable.
2. Metrics must be repeatable.
3. Evaluation must be independent of vendors.
4. Technical teams must be able to improve over time.

MCSS is not about certification control.  
It is about helping technical teams understand where they stand and how to improve.

Good systems are not built by accident.  
They are built by measurable progress.
