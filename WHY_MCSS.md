# Why MCSS Exists

Most infrastructure quality is currently evaluated using fragmented methods.

Organizations usually check:
- Security
- Compliance
- Performance

But configuration maturity is rarely evaluated as a systemic property.

MCSS was created to provide a structured response to this gap.

The philosophy behind MCSS is:

1. Quality must be measurable.
2. Metrics must be repeatable.
3. Evaluation must be independent of vendors.
4. Technical teams must be able to improve over time.

MCSS is not about certification control.  
It is about helping technical teams understand where they stand and how to improve.

Good systems are not built by accident.  
They are built by measurable progress.

## What MCSS Introduces

MCSS introduces a structured maturity scoring model focused on configuration quality.

Rather than performing isolated verification checks, MCSS aims to provide:

- A measurable maturity level
- A repeatable evaluation method
- A framework for progressive improvement

## What MCSS Is Not

MCSS is not:
- A compliance certification scheme
- A security-only audit methodology
- A vendor-specific evaluation tool

It is a configuration maturity framework designed to support operational decision making.
